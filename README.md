Weather Analysis of a potential Surf and Icecream Shop Destination in Hawaii.<br/>
The code I used to conduct my anlayis can be found [Here.](https://github.com/RudyR32/surfs_up/blob/master/climate_analysis.ipynb)

## Challenge Instructions
1.  Identify key statistical data in June across all of the stations and years using the describe() function.(below)<br/>
2. Identify key statistical data in December across all stations and years using the describe() function.(below)<br/>
3. Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook with a few sentences describing the key differences in weather between June and December and 2-3 recommendations for further analysis.

## Key Findings
The Average temperature in June was just under 75 degrees Farenheit where as the average temperature in December way just over 71 degrees Farenheit.  The Min/Max temperature in June was was 64/85 degrees while the Min/Max temperature in December was 56/83 degrees.  The average precipitaion was .22 inches a day in December whereas it was .14 inches a day in June.  To generalize the information an average day in December is slightly colder and more like to be rainy than a day in June.  However, they are relatively similar compared to some areas where conditions can vary wildly.  More detail is shown in the images below. 

## Recomendations for Further Analysis
1.  The first peice of further analysis I would want to conduct would be to quantify the number of people visiting the area during each month of the year.  I think traffic is a much larger indicator of whether the business would be successful given that weather does not vary to a great degree.<br/>
2.  I would want to also quantify water temperature thoughout the year.  I would postualate that water temperature being too low would negatively affect participation rate in water based activities.  Note, I would uess this would not affect the success of the Icecream portion of the business.<br/>
3.  I would also want to quantify the number of surf shops/ icecream shops  in the area to see if the market was already to saturated.
